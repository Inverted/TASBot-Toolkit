# BECAUSE
#### tasBot Eye Color Analyzing Uniquified Search Engine

To use with https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/tasbot_eyes

Converts any given file into a color palette, that can be used with the TASBot eye controller software

### ⚠️ Attention
Program loops over all pixels of the image. Be careful with larges images. Meant to be used with small files, only a few dozen pixels big!

## Usage
`because <path to image>`

## Future ideas
Prevent the color black (`0x000000`) to be added to the palette. Alternatively, the luminance of the color could be calculated first and there could be a threshold, for how dark colors can get.
